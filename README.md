# arduino-barriers


Hey! You just stumbeled across this repository, I had to make barriers with traffic lights for a school project, I decided to post them on GitHub if anyone would be interested.

I don't care what you do with my code.

The code was tested inside TinkerCAD and with a real Arduino (using a HW201 IR-sensor and an SM-S2309S)
